Project for creating small typst watch zines for your watch case. Includes zines for a number of watches created in the "Hablemos de Relojes" watch forum.

# Credits

## Text and Photographs

The watch descriptions for the RSWC and SyS (Sol y Sombra) zines are based on the watch descriptions from the "Hablemos de Relojes" forum, primarily written by user **@Gasparacha**.

Photographs featured in the zines were taken from the forum and were created by:
- **@submariner**
- **@Gasparacha**
- **@Girolamo**
- **@luin**
- **@Martins**
- **@Pirlo**
- **@vegaban**
- **@Drake**
- **@stef**

All content is used with appreciation for the collaborative spirit of the watch enthusiast community.

## Zen Zine Template

This project derives from the **Zen Zine** template for Typst, created by Tom Eichlersmith.

- **Package**: [zen-zine](https://typst.app/universe/package/zen-zine/)
- **License**: MIT License
- **Description**: A template for creating printable 8-page zines from a page of paper

## Typst

This project is built with [Typst](https://typst.app/), a modern typesetting system.

- **Website**: https://typst.app/
- **License**: Apache-2.0

# Usage

The `watch_zine` function in `src/lib.typ` is based on the zen-zine template, adapted for creating watch instruction zines. The template enables the creation of foldable zines with proper page ordering for printing.

## Prerequisites

### Install Typst

Follow the installation instructions at [typst.app](https://typst.app/).

### Install Carlito Font

The zines use the Carlito font (a free, metric-compatible alternative to Calibri). Install it on your system:
https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Carlito 

## Building Zines

### Using CMake

The project uses CMake for automated building with deterministic PDF output:

**Initial Configuration:**
```bash
cmake .
```

**Build all PDFs and PNGs:**
```bash
cmake --build .
# or with specific target:
cmake --build . --target all_zines
```

**Build only PDFs:**
```bash
cmake --build . --target pdf-all
```

**Build only PNG pages:**
```bash
cmake --build . --target png-all
```

**Build specific zine PDF:**
```bash
cmake --build . --target pdf-caballero
```

**Build specific zine PNG pages:**
```bash
cmake --build . --target png-caballero
```

**Clean output directory:**
```bash
cmake --build . --target clean_zines
```

**Show help:**
```bash
cmake --build . --target help_zines
```

**Note**: CMake uses qpdf to generate deterministic PDF files (same hash across builds).

### Output Structure

Source files are organized in `hdr_zines_src/` directory, and PDFs are generated in `HdR zines/`:

```
hdr_zines_src/
├── bushido/
├── ...
│
HdR zines/
├── RSWC Bushido/
│   └── bushido zine.pdf
│   └── bushido zine-1.png
│   ...
│   └── bushido zine-8.png
...
```


## Creating Your Own Zine

1. Create a new directory in `hdr_zines_src/` (e.g., `hdr_zines_src/mywatch/`)
2. Create your `.typ` file with the watch zine content following the 8-page structure
3. Add your watch images (`mywatch_front.jpeg` and `mywatch_back.jpeg`)
4. Add your zine to `CMakeLists.txt` following the pattern of existing zines:
   ```cmake
   add_hdr_zine(mywatch "mywatch" "My Watch Collection" "mywatch.typ")
   ```
   Where:
   - First parameter: zine ID (used for target names: `pdf-mywatch`, `png-mywatch`)
   - Second parameter: source directory name under `hdr_zines_src/`
   - Third parameter: output subdirectory name under `HdR zines/`
   - Fourth parameter: source `.typ` file name

5. Run CMake to update the build configuration:
   ```bash
   cmake .
   cmake --build . --target pdf-mywatch
   ```
