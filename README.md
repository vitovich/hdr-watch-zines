Project for creating small typst watch zines for your watch case. Includes zines for a number of watches created in the "Hablemos de Relojes" watch forum.

# Credits

## Text and Photographs

The watch descriptions for the RSWC and SyS (Sol y Sombra) zines are based on the watch descriptions from the "Hablemos de Relojes" forum, primarily written by user **@Gasparacha**.

Photographs featured in the zines were taken from the forum and were created by:
- **@Gasparacha**
- **@submariner**

All content is used with appreciation for the collaborative spirit of the watch enthusiast community.

## Zen Zine Template

This project derives from the **Zen Zine** template for Typst, created by Tom Eichlersmith.

- **Package**: [zen-zine](https://typst.app/universe/package/zen-zine/)
- **License**: MIT License
- **Description**: A template for creating printable 8-page zines from a page of paper

## Typst

This project is built with [Typst](https://typst.app/), a modern typesetting system.

- **Website**: https://typst.app/
- **License**: Apache-2.0

# Usage

The `watch_zine` function in `src/lib.typ` is based on the zen-zine template, adapted for creating watch instruction zines. The template enables the creation of foldable zines with proper page ordering for printing.

## Prerequisites

### Install Typst

Follow the installation instructions at [typst.app](https://typst.app/).

### Install Carlito Font

The zines use the Carlito font (a free, metric-compatible alternative to Calibri). Install it on your system:
https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Carlito 

## Building Zines

### Using the Build Script (Linux/WSL)

The project includes `build.sh` for automated building:

**Build all zines:**
```bash
./build.sh
```

**Build a specific zine:**
```bash
./build.sh caballero       # SyS Caballero
./build.sh iberia          # RSWC Suite Iberia
./build.sh vainqueur       # RSWC Vainqueur (Spanish)
./build.sh vainqueur_de    # RSWC Vainqueur (German)
./build.sh ala14           # RSWC Super Stellar Ala 14
./build.sh typhoon         # RSWC Super Stellar Typhoon
./build.sh roquina         # SyS Roquina
./build.sh digimatico      # SyS Digimático
./build.sh forest_defender # RSWC Forest Defender
./build.sh inmortal_reserva_especial # SyS Inmortal Reserva Especial
```

**Clean output directory:**
```bash
./build.sh --clean
```

**Show help:**
```bash
./build.sh --help
```

### Output Structure

PDFs are generated in the `HdR zines/` directory:
```

```


## Creating Your Own Zine

1. Copy an existing zine directory (e.g., `template/`)
2. Modify the `.typ` file with your content
3. Add your images
4. Add to `build.sh`:
   ```bash
   # In ZINES array:
   ["mywatch"]="mywatch/mywatch.typ"
   
   # In OUTPUT_SUBDIRS array:
   ["mywatch"]="My Watch Name"
   ```
5. Build: `./build.sh mywatch`
